    <h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good &quot; - John Steinbeck </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The speech that Al Capone gave in <em>Any Given Sunday</em> was 
     <hr> <blockquote>You find out life's this game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so
        small--I mean--one-half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it.<br>
        One half-second too slow, too fast, you don't quite catch it.<br>
        The inches we need are everywhere around us....<br>
        In any fight, it's the guy who's willing to die who's gonna win that inch.
       </blockquote><hr>
